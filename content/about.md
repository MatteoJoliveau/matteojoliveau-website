# Hello World!

My name's Matteo, and I'm a software developer from Europe. I mainly focus on cloud-native infrastructure, API backends and integration systems, and I'm deeply in love with topics like container orchestration, distributed systems and access control management.

## Core Skills

As a solution architect my focus is designing private deployment platforms for enterprises that wish to give developers the same *as a service* feeling as some of the big
PaaS providers, while keeping control of their infrastructure and data. I'm specialized in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) based solutions that are easy to install, maintain, and scale as the project grows.

I led the design and implementation of the [Karavel Container Platform](https://platform.karavel.io), an open-source software toolkit to reliably build custom deployment platforms powered by Kubernetes.

As a software developer I am competent in a wide range of programming languages such as **Rust**, **Elixir**, **ECMAScript/TypeScript**,  **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Ruby**, and **Golang**. I'm confident with a variety of off-the-shelf tools lime **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, **NATS**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Keycloak**.

I'm an experienced system administrator, especially following **DevOps** and **GitOps** practices, and know my way around various **Linux distributions,** **FreeBSD**, **Windows** and **macOS** environments, **OCI containers** (including **Kubernetes** and derivatives) and **CI/CD** pipelines (both services like **CircleCI** and **GitLab CI** and on-prem stuff like **Tekton** and **Drone**).

I'm especially well-versed in **API solutions design**, both **RESTful** and **GraphQL**-based, **event-driven/eventually consistent applications** and **Enterprise Integration Systems** (**Apache Camel** and alike). 
I'm also very skilled in **OAuth2-based protocols**, like **OpenID Connect 1.0** and **User Managed Acces 2.0**, with experience in both consuming and implementing them.
