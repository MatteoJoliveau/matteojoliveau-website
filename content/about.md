# Hello World!

My name's Matteo and I'm a software developer from Europe. I mainly focus on cloud-native solutions, web backends and integration systems, and I'm deeply in love with topics like container orchestration, distributed systems and access control management.

## Core Skills

I'm fairly competent with object oriented and functional programming languages such as **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Ruby**, **ECMAScript/TypeScript** and **Elixir**. I'm also studying more extreme functional languages such as **Haskell** and **ReasonML**.

I'm an experienced system administrator, especially following **DevOps** and **GitOps** practices, and know my way around various **Linux distributions,** **FreeBSD**, **Windows** and **macOS** environments, **Docker containers** (including **Kubernetes** and derivatives) and **CI/CD** pipelines (both services like **CircleCI** and **GitLab CI** and on-prem stuff like **GoCD** and **Drone**).

I'm specialized in **API solutions design**, both **RESTful** and **GraphQL**-based, and Enterprise Integration systems (**Apache Camel** and alike). I'm also taking a deep interest in **OAuth2-based protocols**, like **OpenID Connect 1.0** and **User Managed Acces 2.0**.
