Revest is a luxury clothing eCommerce platform which rents its products instead of selling them.

It's a modern Single Page Application built with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org), backed by a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/) served by a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend.

It leverages several [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) services, like [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/it/cognito/) for authentication and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/it/s3/) for storing files.
